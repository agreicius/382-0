<div class="para">Starting with some simple star-shaped regions like open discs, we can use <a href="s_cauchy_goursat.html#th_elem_regions" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/th_elem_regions.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Theorem 1.14.12: Elementary region building">Theorem 1.14.12</a> to build an extensive collection of elementary domains. Indeed for any explicit example we consider, these tools will suffice to show that a given region is in fact elementary.</div>
<div class="para">That said, it is desirable to have some geometric intuition about whether an open connected set is elementary. As it turns out, there is a purely topological characterization of which subsets of <span class="process-math">\(\C\)</span> are elementary: namely, <span class="process-math">\(U\subseteq \C\)</span> is elementary if and only if it is open and <em class="emphasis">simply connected</em>. The notion of a simply connected set is a tad too technical for us to include in this course, but the intuitive idea is that an open connected set <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is simply connected if given any two paths <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> with the same endpoints, we can be <em class="emphasis">continuously deform</em> <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> without leaving <span class="process-math">\(U\text{.}\)</span> Another, even less technical intuitive description of a simply connected region is that it is connected and <em class="emphasis">contains no holes</em>.</div>
<div class="para">This intuitive notion of simply connected regions (and its relation to elementary regions) will suffice for our purposes. In more detail, given an open connected set <span class="process-math">\(U\text{,}\)</span> we can use this intuition to identify it informally as simply connected or not, and hence as elementary or not. If it is then required of us to prove a given region actually is elementary, then we will be able to do so using <a href="s_cauchy_goursat.html#th_elem_regions" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/th_elem_regions.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Theorem 1.14.12: Elementary region building">Theorem 1.14.12</a>.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="s_cauchy_goursat.html#rm_elementary">in-context</a></span>
