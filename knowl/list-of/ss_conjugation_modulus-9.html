<div class="para">One important difference between <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\C\)</span> is that the former is equipped with the <span class="process-math">\(\leq\)</span> relation, and that this relation does not extend to <span class="process-math">\(\C\)</span> in a useful way. Since we now think of <span class="process-math">\(\R\subseteq \C\)</span> as a subset of <span class="process-math">\(\C\text{,}\)</span> however, we will still have occasion to make assertions about real complex numbers that involve <span class="process-math">\(\leq\text{.}\)</span> As such, whenever we state something of the form <span class="process-math">\(x \leq y\text{,}\)</span> both <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are understood to be real complex numbers.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="s_polar.html#ss_conjugation_modulus-9">in-context</a></span>
