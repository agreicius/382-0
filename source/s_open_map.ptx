<p>
Let <m>f</m> be a complex function with open domain <m>D</m>. We say <m>f</m> is <term>open</term> if for all open sets <m>U\subseteq D</m>, <m>f(U)</m> is open: <ie/>, <m>f</m> maps open sets to open sets.

<title>Locally <m>m</m>-to-one</title>
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>f</m> be a nonconstant analytic function with open connected domain <m>D</m>. Given any open set <m>U\subseteq D</m> and <m>z_0\in U</m>, let <m>w_0=f(z_0)</m>, and let <m>m</m> be the order of <m>z_0</m> as a zero of the function <m>f(z)-w_0</m>. There are open balls <m>B_r(z_0)\subseteq U</m> and <m>B_s(w_0)\subseteq f(U)</m> such that <m>f(z)\ne f(z_0)</m> for all <m>z\ne z_0\in B_r(z_0)</m>, and for all <m>w\ne w_0\in B_s(w_0)</m> there are exactly <m>m</m> elements of <m>B_r(z_0)</m> that map to <m>w</m>, and each of these is a zero of order one of the function <m>f(z)-w</m>. 
</p>
</statement>
<proof>
<p>
    We pick <m>r&gt;0</m> such
    <ol marker="(a)">
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>\overline{B}_r(z_0)\subseteq U</m>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>f(z)\ne f(z_0)</m> for all <m>z\ne z_0</m>,
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
               <m>f'(z)\ne 0</m> for all <m>z\ne z_0</m>.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
     Why can we do this? We will show that there is such an <m>r</m> for each condition (a)-(c) separately; taking the minimum of these gives us an <m>r</m> that satisfies all conditions at once. It is clear from the openness of <m>U</m> that we can find an <m>r</m> satisfying (a). If there were no such <m>r</m> for which (b) is satisfied, then for each <m>r_n=1/n</m>, we could find a <m>z_n\in B_{1/n}(z_0)</m> such that <m>f(z_n)=f(z_0)=w_0</m>. Since and <m>D</m> is connected and <m>z_0</m> is a limit point of the set of <m>z_n</m>, <xref ref="cor_limit_points"/> would imply that <m>f(z)=f(z_0)=w_0</m> for all <m>z\in D</m>, contradicting the fact the <m>f</m> is nonconstant. Similarly, if there were no such <m>r</m> for which (c) is satisfied we could find a sequence of points <m>z_n\to z_0</m> satisfying <m>f'(z_n)=0</m>, and this would imply <m>f'(z)=0</m> for all <m>z\in D</m>, contradicting again that <m>f</m> is nonconstant.  
</p>
<p>
    Having chosen an <m>r&gt; 0</m> satisfying (a)-(c), we let <m>\gamma(t)=z_0+e^{it}</m>, <m>t\in [0,2\pi]</m>. Since <m>f(z)\ne w_0</m> for all <m>z\in B_r(z_0)</m>, we have <m>w_0\notin f\circ \gamma</m>. It follows by the extreme value theorem that we can find an <m>s&gt; 0</m> such that <m>B_s(w_0)\cap \im f\circ \gamma=\emptyset</m>. Since <m>w\notin \im f\circ \gamma</m>, the winding number <m>\chi_{f\circ\gamma}(w)</m> defines a continuous, integer-valued function on <m>B_s(w_0)</m>. Since <m>B_s(w_0)</m> is connected, this winding number <m>\chi_{f\circ\gamma}(w)</m> is constant for all  <m>w\in B_s(w_0)</m>. Since <m>\chi_{f\circ\gamma}(w_0)=\ord_{f-w_0}(z_0)=m</m>, we see that <m>\chi_{f\circ \gamma}(w)=m</m> for all <m>w\in B_s(w_0)</m>. On the other hand, we have 
    <md>
        <mrow>m=\chi_{f\circ\gamma}(w)\amp =\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{f\circ \gamma}\frac{1}{z-w}\, dz</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{f'(\gamma(t))\gamma'(t)}{f(\gamma(t))-w}\, dt</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma \frac{(f(z)-w)'}{f(z)-w}\, dz</mrow>
    </md>,
    and by the <xref ref="th_arg_princ"/>, the last integral is equal to the number of zeros (counting multiplicity) of the function <m>f(z)-w</m> in <m>\Int \gamma=B_r(z_0)</m>. Since <m>f'(z)\ne 0</m> for all <m>z\ne z_0</m>, it follows easily that for each <m>w\ne w_0\in B_s(w_0)</m> and <m>z\in B_r(z_0)</m> satisfying <m>f(z)=w</m>, this <m>z</m> is a <em>simple</em> root of the function <m>f-w</m>: <ie/>, <m>\ord_{f-w}(z)=1</m>. It follows that for each <m>w\ne w_0\in B_s(w)</m> there are exactly <m>m</m> distinct elements <m>z\in B_r(z_0)</m> satisfying <m>f(z)=w</m>. In particular, note that for each <m>w\in B_s(z_0)</m> there is <em>some</em> element <m>z\in B_r(z_0)</m> such that <m>f(z)=w</m>. Thus 
    <me>
        B_s(w_0)\subseteq f(B_r(z_0))
    </me>,
    as claimed.

<p>
If <m>f</m> is nonconstant and analytic on an open connected domain <m>D</m>, then <m>f</m> is open.

</statement>
<proof>
<p>
Given any open <m>U\subseteq D</m> and any <m>w_0=f(z_0)\in f(U)</m>, according to <xref ref="th_locally_m_to_one"/> there are open balls <m>B_r(z_0)\subseteq U</m> and <m>B_s(w_0)</m> such that 
<me>
    B_s(f(z_0))\subseteq f(B_r(z_0))\subseteq f(U)

Thus for all <m>w_0\in f(U)</m> we can find an open ball <m>B_s(w_0)\subseteq f(U)</m>. We conclude that <m>f(U)</m> is open.

    The next result, the famous <em>inverse function theorem</em> is largely the result of applying <xref ref="th_locally_m_to_one"/> and <xref ref="th_open_mapping"/> to the case where <m>f'(z_0)\ne 0</m> (<ie/>, <m>m=1</m>).

<statement>
<p>
Assume <m>f</m> is analytic at <m>z_0</m> and that <m>f'(z_0)\ne 0</m>. There is an open set <m>V</m> containing <m>z_0</m> satisfying the following properties. 
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
           The restriction <m>f\colon V\rightarrow f(V)</m> is bijective and <m>f'</m> is nonzero on <m>V</m>.

    </li>
</ol>
</p>
</statement>
<proof>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Since <m>f'(z_0)\ne 0</m>, <m>z_0</m> is a simple zero of the function <m>h(z)=f(z)-f(z_0)</m>. We are thus in the <m>m=1</m> situation of <xref ref="th_locally_m_to_one"/>. Let <m>B_r(z_0)</m> and <m>B_s(f(z_0))</m> be open balls satisfying the conditions of that theorem. The set 
                <me>
                    V=f^{-1}(B_s(f(z_0)))\cap B_r(z_0)
                </me>
                is an open set containing <m>z_0</m> on which <m>f</m> is injective (1-to-1) and <m>f'</m> is nonzero. The restricted function <m>f\colon V\rightarrow f(V)</m> is thus bijective. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                We first show that <m>f^{-1}\colon f(V)\rightarrow V</m> is continuous. This will follow from the fact <m>f</m> is an open map. For notational clarity, we let <m>g=f^{-1}</m>. Using the defining property of the inverse function, <m>g</m> satisfies 
                <md>
                    <mrow>g(f(z)) \amp = z, \text{ for all } z\in V \amp f(g(w))\amp =w \text{ for all } w\in f(V)</mrow>
                </md>.  
                To show <m>g</m> is continuous we will prove the following equivalent property (shown in one of your homework assignments): if <m>W\subseteq V</m> is open, then <m>g^{-1}(W)\subseteq f(V)</m> is open. But this is easy: given any open <m>W\subseteq V</m> it is easy to see that 
                <me>
                    g^{-1}(W)=(f^{-1})^{-1}(W)=f(W)
                </me>,
                which is open since <m>f</m> is an open map. This proves <m>g=f^{-1}\colon f(V)\rightarrow V</m> is continuous.
            </p>
            <p>
                It remains only to prove that <m>f^{-1}</m> is differentiable at all <m>w\in f(V)</m>: it turns out this is not so difficult to prove once we know <m>f^{-1}</m> is continuous. Although it is straightforward to prove the formula <xref ref="eq_deriv_inv"/> using the limit definition of the derivative, we will instead use Caratheory's equivalent notion of differentiability (mentioned in homework) as an illustration of this technique's pleasing algebraic nature. Given <m>w\in f(V)</m>, we have <m>w=f(z)</m> for some <m>z\in V</m>. Since <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>z</m> there is a function <m>\phi</m> satisfying the following conditions:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>f(z')=\phi(z')(z'-z)+f(z)</m> for all <m>z'\in V</m>,
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>\phi</m> is continuous at <m>z</m> and satisfies <m>\phi(z)=f'(z)</m>. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                Note that since <m>f'</m> is nonzero on <m>V</m>, we have <m>\phi(z)\ne 0</m>. Since <m>\phi</m> is continuous at <m>z</m>, we can find an open ball <m>B</m> around <m>z</m> such that <m>\phi(z')\ne 0</m> for all <m>z'\in B</m>.  After a little algebra we see that 
                <me>
                    z'=\frac{1}{\phi(z')}(f(z')-f(z))+z
                </me>
                for all <m>z'\in B</m>, or equivalently, 
                <me>
                    f^{-1}(w')=\frac{1}{\phi(f^{-1}(w'))}(w'-w)+f^{-1}(w)
                </me>
                for all <m>w'</m> in the open set <m>f(B)</m>. Since <m>f^{-1}</m> is continuous, the function <m>\psi=\frac{1}{\phi\circ f^{-1}}</m> is continuous at <m>w</m> and satisfies 
                <me>
                    f^{-1}(w')=\psi(w')(w'-w)+f^{-1}(w)
                </me>
                for all <m>w'\in f(B)</m>. Caratheodory's theorem now implies that <m>f^{-1}</m> is differentiable at <m>w</m> and we have 
                <me>
                    (f^{-1})'(w)=\psi(w)=\frac{1}{\phi(f^{-1}(w))}=\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(w))}
                </me>,

        <p>
            Since <m>f</m> is analytic and nonconstant, it is an open map. Each proof below will make use of this fact.

                    <p>
                        Given any <m>z_0\in U</m> and open ball <m>B_r(z_0)\subseteq U</m>, since <m>f(B_r(z_0))</m> is open, there is an open ball <m>B_s(f(z_0))\subseteq f(B_r(z_0))</m>. Clearly <m>B_s(f(z_0))</m> will contain an element <m>w</m> with <m>\abs{w}&gt; \abs{f(z_0)}</m>. Since <m>B_s(f(z_0))\subseteq f(B_r(z_0))</m>, we have <m>w=f(z)</m> for some <m>z\in B_r(z_0)</m>. Thus for all open balls <m>B_r(z_0)</m> we can find a <m>z\in B_r(z_0)</m> such that <m>\abs{f(z)}&gt; f(z_0)</m>.

                        If the minimum value <m>\abs{f(z_1)}</m> is nonzero, then (2) implies that <m>z_1\notin K^\circ</m>. Thus <m>z_1\in \partial K</m>, and we see in this case that the minimum value of <m>\abs{f}</m> is attained only on <m>\partial K</m>.

    <title>Schwarz's lemma</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
            If <m>f</m> is analytic on <m>B_1(0)</m> and satisfies <m>f(0)=0</m> and <m>\abs{f(z)}\leq 1</m> for all <m>z\in B_1(0)</m>, then <m>\abs{f(z)}\leq \abs{z}</m> for all <m>z\in B_1(0)</m>, and <m>\abs{f'(0)}\leq 1</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, if <m>\abs{f(z)}=\abs{z}</m> for some <m>z\in B_1(0)</m>, or if <m>\abs{f'(z_0)}=1</m>, then <m>f(z)=e^{i\alpha}z</m> for some <m>z\in </m>: <ie/>, <m>f</m> is the rotation by <m>\alpha</m> transformation in this case.

    <proof>
        <p>
            Since <m>f(0)=0</m>, we may write <m>f(z)=zg(z)</m> where <m>g(z)</m> is analytic on <m>B_1(0)</m>. Since <m>\abs{f(z)}\leq 1</m> for all <m>z\in B_1(0)</m>, we have 
            <me>
                \abs{g(z)}\leq \frac{1}{\abs{z}}
            </me>
            for all <m>z\ne 0</m>. Given any <m>r\in (0,1)</m>, since <m>g</m> is analytic, on <m>K=\overline{B}_r(0)</m> the function <m>\abs{g}</m> attains its maximum value on the boundary <m>\partial K</m>. Since <m>\abs{g(z)}\leq \frac{1}{r}</m> on <m>\partial K</m>, we conclude that <m>\abs{g(z)}\leq \frac{1}{r}</m> for all <m>z\in \overline{B}_r(0)</m>. Since this is true for all <m>r\in (0,1)</m>, we conclude that <m>\abs{g(z)}\leq 1</m> for all <m>z\in B_1(0)</m>. Since <m>f(z)=zg(z)</m>, it follows that <m>\abs{f(z)}\leq \abs{z}</m> for all <m>z\in B_1(0)</m>. Lastly, since <m>f'(z)=g(0)</m>, we see that <m>\abs{f'(z)}\leq 1</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, if there is an element <m>z\in B_1(0)</m> satisfying <m>\abs{f(z)}=\abs{z}</m>, or if <m>\abs{f'(0)}=\abs{g(0)}</m>, then <m>\abs{g}</m> attains an absolute maximum value of 1 on <m>B_1(0)</m>. By <xref ref="th_max_min_modulus"/> we must have <m>g</m> a constant function of modulus 1. It follows that <m>g(z)=e^{i\alpha}</m> for some <m>\alpha\in \R</m>, and thus <m>f(z)=e^{i\alpha}z</m>, as claimed.
