The linear transformation <m>T\colon \R^2\rightarrow \R^2</m> defined as <m>T(x,y)=(x,-y)</m> preserves angles, but not oriented angles: the oriented angle from <m>\boldv=(1,0)</m> to <m>\boldw=(0,1)</m> is <m>\pi/2</m>, but the oriented angle from <m>T(\boldv)=(1,0)</m> and <m>T(0,1)=(0,-1)</m> is <m>-\pi/2</m>.

        <title>Geometric interpretation</title>
        <p>
            The chain rule allows us to give a more geometric interpretation of conformality. Assume <m>f</m> is conformal at the point <m>P=(x_0,y_0)</m>, and suppose <m>\phi</m> and <m>\psi</m> are two smooth paths defined on an interval <m>[-a,a]</m> satisfying 
            <md>
                <mrow>\phi(0) \amp = \psi(0)=(x_0,y_0)</mrow>
                <mrow>\phi'(0) \amp \ne \boldzero, \psi'(0)\ne \boldzero</mrow>
            </md>.
            Composing <m>\phi</m> and <m>\psi</m> yields smooth paths <m>f\circ \phi</m> and <m>f\circ \psi</m> intersecting at 
            <me>
                f(P)=f\circ\phi(0)=f\circ\psi(0)
            </me>.
            Using the multivariable chain rule, the tangent vectors of the two curves at <m>f(P)</m> are given as 
            <md>
                <mrow>(f\circ\phi)'(0) \amp = J_f(P)\phi'(0) </mrow>
                <mrow>(f\circ \psi)'(0) \amp = J_f(P)\psi'(0) </mrow>
            </md>.
            Since <m>J_f(P)</m> is a conformal matrix, we conclude that the oriented angle between the tangent vectors of the paths <m>\phi</m> and <m>\psi</m> at <m>P</m> is equal to the oriented angle between the tangent vectors of the images of these paths under <m>f</m> at <m>f(P)</m>.

    <p>
    Let <m>a,b,c,d\in \C</m> be complex constants for which the matrix <m>A=\begin{bmatrix}
    a\amp b\\ c\amp d
    \end{bmatrix}</m> satisfies <m>\det A=ad-bc\ne 0</m>. The <term>Möbius transformation</term> (or <term>fractional linear transformation</term>)  associated to <m>A</m> is the function

    </men>.
    </p>
    </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
        It is clear that a Möbius transformation <m>f_A</m> as in <xref ref="eq_mobius"/> has <em>at most</em> one isolated singularity at <m>z_0=-d/c</m> (assuming <m>c\ne 0</m>), where <m>f_A</m> has a simple pole, and in this case <m>\lim\limits_{z\to z_0}f_A(z)=\infty</m>. Furthermore, a straightforward computation reveals that
        <me>
        \lim\limits_{z\to \infty}f(z)=\begin{cases}
        \frac{a}{c}\amp \text{if } c\ne 0 \\
        \infty \amp \text{if } c=0
        \end{cases}
        </me>.
        Let <m>C^*=\C\cup \{\infty\}</m>, the Riemann sphere.  The observations allow us to extend <m>f_A</m> to a function <m>f_A\colon \C^*\rightarrow \C^*</m> by defining
        <me>
            f_A(z_0)=\lim\limits_{z\to z_0}f_A(z)
        </me>.
        Note that for all <m>z_0\in \C-\{z\colon cz+d=0\}</m> this formula agrees with <m>\frac{az_0+b}{cz_0+d}</m> since the original function <m>f_A</m> is continuous there.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the theorem below illustrates, this more expanded setting gives rise to a tidy conceptual understanding of Möbius transformations. Before we get there, we need to generalize the notion of a circle to reflect the geometry of the Riemann sphere.

    <title>Generalized circle</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
    We call any line or circle in <m>\C</m> a <term>generalized circle</term>. Furthermore we say that a line <m>\ell</m> is a <term>generalized circle containing <m>\infty</m></term>. 
    </p>
    </statement>
    </definition>
    <remark>
    <title>Generalized circle</title>
    <p>
    Let <m>S^2=\{(x,y,z)\in \R^3\colon x^2+y^2+z^2=1\}</m>, and let <m>\phi\colon S^2\rightarrow \C*=\C\cup \{\infty\}</m> be the stereographic projection. (See <xref ref="d_stereo_proj"/>.) By a circle in <m>S^2</m> we mean any latitude line with respect to a chosen pole <m>P=(a,b,c)\in S^2</m>. (Such a latitude line can be described as the intersection of <m>S^2</m> with a plane of the form <m>ax+by+cz=d</m> for some <m>d\in \R</m>.) It can be shown that the image under <m>\phi</m> of any circle in <m>C\subseteq S^2</m> is either a circle or line, and that <m>\phi(C)</m> is a line if and only if <m>C</m> contains <m>N=(0,0,1)</m>.  
    </p>
    <p>
        In other words, generalized circles in <m>\C</m> correspond precisely to circles in <m>S^2</m> under the stereographic projection; and in particular, lines in <m>\C</m> correspond to circles containing <m>N=(0,0,1)</m> (which corresponds to <m>\infty</m> under <m>\phi</m>). This explains where this terminology comes from.

        According to <m>(6)</m> of <xref ref="th_mobius_trans"/>, once we know the value of a Möbius transformation <m>f</m> at three distinct inputs <m>z_1,z_2,z_3</m>, we can determine <m>f(z)</m> for any <m>z\in \C^*</m>.

                    <m>f</m> is continuous. As such given any connected region <m>R</m>, <m>f(R)</m> is connected. Furthermore because <m>f</m> has a continuous inverse, it follows that <m>f</m> maps the boundary of <m>R</m> to the boundary of <m>f(R)</m>.

                Writing <m>g(z)=(az+b)/(cz+d)</m>, since <m>g(0)=-1</m> and <m>g(\infty)=1</m>,  we see that <m>b=-d</m> and <m>a=c</m>, Thus <m>g(z)=(az+b)/(az-b)</m>.  Next since <m>a(-b)-ab=-2ab\ne 0</m>, we must have <m>a\ne 0</m> and <m>b\ne 0</m>. Lastly, since  <m>g(i)=0</m>, we have <m>ai=-b</m>, or <m>a=ib</m>. Thus we can choose 
                <men xml:id="eq_mobius_matrix">
                    A=\begin{bmatrix}
                    ib\amp b\\ 
                    ib\amp -b
                    \end{bmatrix}
                </men>
                for any <m>b\ne 0\in \C</m>. In particular, we can set <m>b=-i</m>, in which case 
                <me>
                    A=\begin{bmatrix}
                    1\amp -i\\
                    1\amp i
                    \end{bmatrix}
                </me>.
                Note that although there are infinitely many different matrices <m>A</m> satisfying <m>g=f_A</m> (one for each nonzero <m>b</m>), they all give rise to the same function <m>g</m>. Indeed, given any <m>A</m> as in <xref ref="eq_mobius_matrix"/> we have 
                <me>
                    g(z)=\frac{ibz+b}{ibz-b}=\frac{ib}{ib}\frac{z-i}{z+1}=\frac{z-i}{z+i}
                </me>.
                My particular choice of <m>b=-i</m> yields a particularly simple matrix that makes life easier in the next two parts.

                Using your favorite algorithm for writing an invertible matrix as a product of elementary matrices, we have 
                <me>
                \begin{bmatrix}
                1\amp i\\ 1\amp -i
                \end{bmatrix}
                =\begin{bmatrix}
                1\amp 0\\ 1\amp 1
                \end{bmatrix}
                \begin{bmatrix}
                1\amp 0\\ 0\amp -2i
                \end{bmatrix}
                \begin{bmatrix}
                1\amp i \\
                0\amp 1
                \end{bmatrix}
                </me>. 
                Writing this equality as <m>A=BCD</m>, we have 
                <me>
                    g=f_A=f_B\circ f_C\circ f_D
                </me>,
                where 
                <md>
                    <mrow>f_B(z) \amp =\frac{z}{z+1}=\frac{1}{1+1/z}</mrow>
                    <mrow>f_C(z) \amp = \frac{z}{-2i}=\frac{i}{2}z</mrow>
                    <mrow>f_D(z) \amp =z+i </mrow>
                </md>.
                We see that <m>f_C</m> is a dilation and <m>f_D</m> is a translation. Furthermore we can write <m>f_B=p\circ q\circ p</m>, where <m>p(z)=1/z</m> (inversion), and <m>q(w)=w+1</m> (translation). Thus 
                <me>
                    g=p\circ q\circ p\circ f_C\circ f_D
                </me>
                is our desired breakdown of <m>g</m> into dilations, translations, and inversions.

                We have <m>g^{-1}=f_B</m>, where <m>B</m> is any scalar multiple of

                    A^{-1}=\frac{i}{2}\begin{bmatrix}
                    -i\amp -i\\ 
                    -1\amp 1
                    \end{bmatrix}
                </me>.
                We take 
                <me>
                    B=2A=\begin{bmatrix}
                    1\amp 1\\

                    \end{bmatrix}
                </me>
                Thus 
                <me>
                    g^{-1}(z)=\frac{z+1}{-iz+i}=i\cdot\frac{z+1}{z-1}
                </me>.

                It is possible to answer this question without ever making using of our explicit formula for <m>g</m>, using instead only the the fact that <m>g</m> is biholomorphic, conformal, maps generalized circles to generalized circles, and maps <m>0,1,\infty</m> to <m>-1,0,1</m>, respectively. For the sake of brevity, however, we will <q>cheat</q> here and there, and evaluate <m>g</m> at some other points. For example, it helps us to observe that <m>g</m> has a pole at <m>z_0=-i</m> (and thus <m>g(-i)=\infty</m>).  
            </p>
            <p>
                Let <m>\ell</m> be the imaginary axis. We know <m>g(\ell\cup\{\infty\})</m> is a generalized circle containing <m>g(0)=-1</m>, <m>g(i)=0</m> and <m>g(\infty)=1</m>. There is no circle containing these three points, so <m>g(\ell\cup \{\infty\})</m> must be the real axis. Since <m>g(\infty)=1</m>, we conclude that <m>g(\ell)=\R-\{1\}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's nail down some names for various open half-planes: 
                <md>
                    <mrow>N\amp = \{z\in \C\colon \Im z&gt; 0\} </mrow>
                    <mrow>S \amp =\{z\in \C \colon \Im z&lt; 0\}</mrow>
                    <mrow>E \amp =\{z\in \C\colon \Re z&lt; 0\}</mrow>
                    <mrow>W\amp = \{z\in \C\colon \Re z&gt; 0\} </mrow>
                </md>.
                As you can tell, I am thinking in terms of north, south, east, and west. Note that each of these regions is open and connected. Since <m>g(\ell)=\R-\{0\}</m> and <m>g</m> is bijective, we have <m>g(E)\subseteq N\cup S</m>. Since <m>g(E)</m> is connected and and since <m>N\cap S=\emptyset</m>, we must have <m>g(E)\subseteq N</m> or <m>g(E)\subseteq S</m>. Since <m>g(1)=(1-i)/(1+i)=-i\in S</m>, we see that <m>g(E)\subseteq S</m>. Applying the inverse <m>g^{-1}</m> to this inclusion, we see further that <m>E\subseteq g^{-1}(S)</m>. Since <m>g^{-1}(S)\subseteq W</m> or <m>g^{-1}(S)\subseteq E</m> (using similar reasoning as above), the inclusion <m>E\subseteq g^{-1}(S)</m> implies <m>g^{-1}(S)\subseteq E</m>. We conclude that <m>S\subseteq g(E)</m> and thus that <m>g(E)=S</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Since <m>g(0)=-1</m>, <m>g(1)=-i</m>, and <m>g(\infty)=1</m>, we see that <m>g(\R\cup \{\infty\})</m> is a generalized circe containing <m>-1,-i, 1</m>. The unit circle, <m>S^1=\{z\in \C\colon \abs{z}=1\}</m> is the only such generalized circle. Thus <m>g(\R\cup \{\infty\})=S^1</m> and <m>g(\R)=S^1-\{1\}</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Continue to denote the upper half-plane as <m>N</m>.  Since <m>g(\R)=S^1-\{1\}</m> and <m>g(N)</m> is connected, we must have <m>g(N)</m> lying entirely within the unit circle or entirely without it. Since <m>g(i)=0</m>, we conclude that <m>g(N)\subseteq B_1(0)</m>. Now making use of <m>g^{-1}</m> we can argue further (similarly as above) that <m>g^{-1}(B_1(0))\subseteq N </m>, and hence <m>B_1(0)\subseteq g(N)</m>. We conclude that <m>g(N)=B_1(0)</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the line <m>\ell'</m> defined as <m>\Im z=1</m> lies in the upper half-plane, we see that <m>g(\ell' \cup \{\infty\})</m> must be a generalized circle <m>C</m> lying within <m>g(N)=B_1(0)\cup \{1\}</m> and containing <m>g(i)=0</m> and <m>g(\infty)=1</m>. Since <m>C</m> is bounded, it must be an honest to goodness circle.  We could get one more point on <m>C</m> by computing <m>g(1+i)</m>, but instead we argue using conformality. The paths <m>\gamma(t)=(t+1)i</m> and <m>\psi(t)=t+i</m> intersect at <m>i</m> where their tangents form an oriented angle of <m>\pi/2</m> (from <m>\phi</m> to <m>\gamma</m>). Since <m>g</m> is conformal, the paths <m>g\circ \gamma</m> and <m>g\circ \psi</m> intersect at <m>g(i)=0</m> at an oriented angle of <m>\pi/2</m>. Since <m>g\circ \gamma</m> points tangentially along the real line (from above), and <m>g\circ\psi</m> points tangentially along the circle <m>C</m> at the point <m>0</m>, we see that the tangent line to <m>C</m> at <m>0</m> is vertical! A geometric argument then shows we must have <m>C=\{z\in \C\colon \abs{z-1/2}=1/2\}</m>.
