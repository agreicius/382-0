    <title>Rouché's theorem and open mapping theorem</title>
    <p>
        In this section we prove an important consequence of the argument principle: Rouché's theorem.

<theorem xml:id="th_rouches">
<title>Rouché's theorem</title>
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be analytic functions on the elementary region  <m>U</m>, and let <m>\gamma</m> be a closed path in <m>U</m>  elementary region, let <m>\alpha</m> be a closed path such that <m>\chi_\gamma(z)=1</m> for all <m>z\in \Int \alpha</m>. If <m>\abs{g(z)}&lt; \abs{f(z)}</m> for all <m>z\in \im \gamma</m>, then <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> have the same number of zeros in <m>\Int \gamma</m> (counting multiplicity). 
</p>
</statement>
<proof>
    <title>Proof A</title>
<p>
    Observe first that the condition <m>\abs{f(z)}&gt; \abs{g(z)}</m> for all <m>z\in \im \gamma</m> implies that <m>f(z)\ne 0</m> and <m>f(z)+g(z)\ne 0</m> for all <m>z\in \im \gamma</m>. 
</p>
<p>
    Let <m>Z_f=\{z\in \Int \gamma\colon f(z)=0\}</m> and <m>Z_{f+g}=\{z\in \Int \gamma\colon (f+g)(z)=0\}</m>. We wish to show that 
    <men xml:id="eq_zeros_f_fplusg">
        \sum_{z\in Z_f}\ord_f(z)=\sum_{z\in Z_{f+g}}\ord_{f+g}(z)
    </men>.
    This is the precise way of stating that the number of zeros of <m>f</m> in <m>\Int \gamma</m> is equal to the number of zeros of <m>f+g</m> in <m>\Int \gamma</m> (counting multipilicty). 
    </p>
    <p>    
    Since <m>f</m> is nonzero on <m>\im \gamma</m> we have <m>f+g=f(1+g/f)</m> on <m>\im \gamma</m>. Letting <m>h=1+g/f</m>, we have 
    <md>
        <mrow>\sum_{z\in Z_{f+g}}\ord_{f+g}(z)\amp =\chi_{(f+g)\circ \gamma}(0)  </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \chi_{(fh)\circ \gamma}(0)</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\chi_{(f\circ \gamma) \cdot (h\circ \gamma)}(0) </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \chi_{f\circ\gamma}(0)+\chi_{h\circ \gamma}(0)</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \sum_{z\in Z_{f}}\ord_{f}(z)+\chi_{h\circ \gamma}(0)</mrow>
    </md>.
    The penultimate equality is an instance of the more general property <m>\chi_{\psi\cdot\phi}(0)=\chi_{\psi}(0)+\chi_{\phi}(0)</m>, which is essentially a consequence of the product rule for derivatives. (We leave this elementary proof to the reader.) 
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, observe that since <m>\abs{g(z)}&lt; \abs{f(z)}</m> for all <m>z\in \im \gamma</m>, we have 
    <me>
        \im h\circ \gamma\subseteq B_1(1)
    </me>.
    Since <m>B_1(1)</m> is an elementary region, it follows from <xref ref="cor_int_ext"/> that <m>\Int h\circ \gamma\subseteq B_1(1)</m>, and hence that <m>\chi_{h\circ\gamma}(0)=0</m>. We conclude that 
    <md>
        <mrow>\sum_{z\in Z_{f+g}}\ord_{f+g}(z)=\sum_{z\in Z_f}\ord_f(z)</mrow>
    </md>,
    as desired.
    
</p>
</proof>
<proof>
    <title>Proof B (sketch)</title>
    <p>
        As an alternative, somewhat slicker proof, consider the function <m>h\colon [0,1]\rightarrow \Z</m> defined as 
        <md>
            <mrow>h(t) \amp = \chi_{(f+tg)\circ \gamma}(0)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma \frac{f'+tg'}{f+tg}\, dz</mrow>
        </md>.
        First show that <m>h</m> is continuous, then conclude that <m>h</m> is constant, since <m>[0,1]</m> is connected and <m>\Z</m> is discrete. It follows that <m>\chi_{f\circ\gamma}=h(0)=h(1)=\chi_{(f+g)\circ \gamma}</m>, as desired.
