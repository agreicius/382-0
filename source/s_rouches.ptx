    <title>Rouché's theorem and open mapping theorem</title>
<introduction>
    <p>
        We treat here two far-reaching consequences of our winding number theory: Rouché's theorem and the open mapping theorem (and consequences).

<title>Rouché's theorem</title>
<theorem xml:id="th_rouches">
<title>Rouché's theorem</title>
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be analytic functions on the elementary region  <m>U</m>, and let <m>\gamma</m> be a closed path in <m>U</m>  elementary region, let <m>\alpha</m> be a closed path such that <m>\chi_\gamma(z)=1</m> for all <m>z\in \Int \alpha</m>. If <m>\abs{g(z)}&lt; \abs{f(z)}</m> for all <m>z\in \im \gamma</m>, then <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> have the same number of zeros in <m>\Int \gamma</m> (counting multiplicity). 
</p>
</statement>
<proof>
    <title>Proof A</title>
<p>
    Observe first that the condition <m>\abs{f(z)}&gt; \abs{g(z)}</m> for all <m>z\in \im \gamma</m> implies that <m>f(z)\ne 0</m> and <m>f(z)+g(z)\ne 0</m> for all <m>z\in \im \gamma</m>. 
</p>
<p>
    Let <m>Z_f=\{z\in \Int \gamma\colon f(z)=0\}</m> and <m>Z_{f+g}=\{z\in \Int \gamma\colon (f+g)(z)=0\}</m>. We wish to show that 
    <men xml:id="eq_zeros_f_fplusg">
        \sum_{z\in Z_f}\ord_f(z)=\sum_{z\in Z_{f+g}}\ord_{f+g}(z)
    </men>.
    This is the precise way of stating that the number of zeros of <m>f</m> in <m>\Int \gamma</m> is equal to the number of zeros of <m>f+g</m> in <m>\Int \gamma</m> (counting multipilicty). 
    </p>
    <p>    
    Since <m>f</m> is nonzero on <m>\im \gamma</m> we have <m>f+g=f(1+g/f)</m> on <m>\im \gamma</m>. Letting <m>h=1+g/f</m>, we have 
    <md>
        <mrow>\sum_{z\in Z_{f+g}}\ord_{f+g}(z)\amp =\chi_{(f+g)\circ \gamma}(0)  </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \chi_{(fh)\circ \gamma}(0)</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\chi_{(f\circ \gamma) \cdot (h\circ \gamma)}(0) </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \chi_{f\circ\gamma}(0)+\chi_{h\circ \gamma}(0)</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \sum_{z\in Z_{f}}\ord_{f}(z)+\chi_{h\circ \gamma}(0)</mrow>
    </md>.
    The penultimate equality is an instance of the more general property <m>\chi_{\psi\cdot\phi}(0)=\chi_{\psi}(0)+\chi_{\phi}(0)</m>, which is essentially a consequence of the product rule for derivatives. (We leave this elementary proof to the reader.) 
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, observe that since <m>\abs{g(z)}&lt; \abs{f(z)}</m> for all <m>z\in \im \gamma</m>, we have 
    <me>
        \im h\circ \gamma\subseteq B_1(1)
    </me>.
    Since <m>B_1(1)</m> is an elementary region, it follows from <xref ref="cor_int_ext"/> that <m>\Int h\circ \gamma\subseteq B_1(1)</m>, and hence that <m>\chi_{h\circ\gamma}(0)=0</m>. We conclude that 
    <md>
        <mrow>\sum_{z\in Z_{f+g}}\ord_{f+g}(z)=\sum_{z\in Z_f}\ord_f(z)</mrow>
    </md>,
    as desired.
    
</p>
</proof>
<proof>
    <title>Proof B (sketch)</title>
    <p>
        As an alternative, somewhat slicker proof, consider the function <m>h\colon [0,1]\rightarrow \Z</m> defined as 
        <md>
            <mrow>h(t) \amp = \chi_{(f+tg)\circ \gamma}(0)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma \frac{f'+tg'}{f+tg}\, dz</mrow>
        </md>.
        First show that <m>h</m> is continuous, then conclude that <m>h</m> is constant, since <m>[0,1]</m> is connected and <m>\Z</m> is discrete. It follows that <m>\chi_{f\circ\gamma}=h(0)=h(1)=\chi_{(f+g)\circ \gamma}</m>, as desired.

Let <m>f</m> be a nonconstant analytic function with open connected domain <m>D</m>.

     Why can we do this? We will show that there is such an <m>r</m> for each condition (a)-(c) separately; taking the minimum of these gives us an <m>r</m> that satisfies all conditions at once. It is clear from the openness of <m>U</m> that we can find an <m>r</m> satisfying (a). If there were no such <m>r</m> for which (b) is satisfied, then for each <m>r_n=1/n</m>, we could find a <m>z_n\in B_{1/n}(z_0)</m> such that <m>f(z_n)=f(z_0)=w_0</m>. Since and <m>D</m> is connected and <m>z_0</m> is a limit point of the set of <m>z_n</m>, <xref ref="cor_limit_points"/> would imply that <m>f(z)=f(z_0)=w_0</m> for all <m>z\in D</m>, contradicting the fact the <m>f</m> is nonconstant. Similarly, if there were no such <m>r</m> for which (c) is satisfied we could find a sequence of points <m>z_n\to z_0</m> satisfying <m>f'(z_n)=0</m>, and this would imply <m>f'(z)=0</m> for all <m>z\in D</m>, contradicting again that <m>f</m> is nonconstant.  
</p>
<p>
    Having chosen an <m>r&gt; 0</m> satisfying (a)-(c), we let <m>\gamma(t)=z_0+e^{it}</m>, <m>t\in [0,2\pi]</m>. Since <m>f(z)\ne w_0</m> for all <m>z\in B_r(z_0)</m>, we have <m>w_0\notin f\circ \gamma</m>. It follows by the extreme value theorem that we can find an <m>s&gt; 0</m> such that <m>B_s(w_0)\cap \im f\circ \gamma=\emptyset</m>. Since <m>w\notin \im f\circ \gamma</m>, the winding number <m>\chi_{f\circ\gamma}(w)</m> defines a continuous, integer-valued function on <m>B_s(w_0)</m>. Since <m>B_s(w_0)</m> is connected, this winding number <m>\chi_{f\circ\gamma}(w)</m> is constant for all  <m>w\in B_s(w_0)</m>. Since <m>\chi_{f\circ\gamma}(w_0)=\ord_{f-w_0}(z_0)=m</m>, we see that <m>\chi_{f\circ \gamma}(w)=m</m> for all <m>w\in B_s(w_0)</m>. On the other hand, we have 
    <md>
        <mrow>m=\chi_{f\circ\gamma}(w)\amp =\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{f\circ \gamma}\frac{1}{z-w}\, dz</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{f'(\gamma(t))\gamma'(t)}{f(\gamma(t))-w}\, dt</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma \frac{(f(z)-w)'}{f(z)-w}\, dz</mrow>
    </md>,
    and by the <xref ref="th_arg_princ"/>, the last integral is equal to the number of zeros (counting multiplicity) of the function <m>f(z)-w</m> in <m>\Int \gamma=B_r(z_0)</m>. Since <m>f'(z)\ne 0</m> for all <m>z\ne z_0</m>, it follows easily that for each <m>w\ne w_0\in B_s(w_0)</m> and <m>z\in B_r(z_0)</m> satisfying <m>f(z)=w</m>, this <m>z</m> is a <em>simple</em> root of the function <m>f-w</m>: <ie/>, <m>\ord_{f-w}(z)=1</m>. It follows that for each <m>w\ne w_0\in B_s(w)</m> there are exactly <m>m</m> distinct elements <m>z\in B_r(z_0)</m> satisfying <m>f(z)=w</m>. In particular, note that for each <m>w\in B_s(z_0)</m> there is <em>some</em> element <m>z\in B_r(z_0)</m> such that <m>f(z)=w</m>. Thus 
    <me>
        B_s(w_0)\subseteq f(B_r(z_0))
    </me>,
    as claimed.

<p>
If <m>f</m> is nonconstant and analytic on an open connected domain <m>D</m>, then <m>f</m> is open.

</statement>
<proof>
<p>
Given any open <m>U\subseteq D</m> and any <m>w_0=f(z_0)\in f(U)</m>, according to <xref ref="th_locally_m_to_one"/> there is are open balls <m>B_r(z_0)\subseteq U</m> and <m>B_s(w_0)</m> such that 
<me>
    B_s(f(z_0))\subseteq f(B_r(z_0))\subseteq f(U)

Thus for all <m>w_0\in f(U)</m> we can find an open ball <m>B_s(w_0)\subseteq f(U)</m>. We conclude that <m>f(U)</m> is open.
