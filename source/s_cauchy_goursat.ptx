    <title>Cauchy-Goursat theorem</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In this section we meet the famous Cauchy-Goursat theorem: our first truly deep theorem, and one that is fundamental to all the theoretical highlights that follow.

<title>Existence of antiderivatives</title>

    <title>Paths</title>
    <p>
        From now on, unless explicitly stated otherwise, a path <m>\gamma\colon [a,b]\rightarrow \C</m> will be assumed to be piecewise smooth. 
    </p>
</convention>
<p>
    As we observed in <xref ref="cor_FTC"/>, if <m>f</m> has an antiderivative on the open set <m>U</m>, then <m>\int_\gamma f\, dz=0</m> for any closed path lying in <m>U</m>. Equivalently, if <m>\int_\gamma f\, dz\ne 0</m> <em>for some</em> closed path lying in <m>U</m>, then there is no antiderivative of <m>f</m> on <m>U</m>. 
</p>
<p>
    Applying this result to <m>f(z)=1/z</m>, we see that for any open connected set <m>U</m> containing <m>0</m>, there is no antiderivative of <m>f</m> on <m>U-\{0\}</m>: indeed, the path <m>\gamma(t)=re^{it}</m> lies in <m>U</m> for <m>r</m> small enough, and we have computed that <m>\int_\gamma 1/z\, dz=2\pi i\ne 0</m> for any such path. As a further consequence, it follows that there can be no branch of <m>\log</m> on an open set of the form <m>U-\{0\}</m> where <m>U</m> contains <m>0</m>, since as we have seen previously, any such branch would be an antiderivative of <m>f</m>!
</p>
<p>
    The example illustrates the subtlety of the question of whether an antiderivative exists for a continuous complex function. The next theorem tells us that the implication from <xref ref="cor_FTC"/> is in fact an equivalence if <m>U</m> is open and connected.  
</p>
<theorem xml:id="th_antider">
<title>Antiderivative theorem</title>
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>U\subseteq \C</m> be open and connected, and assume <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>U</m>. The following statements are equivalent. 
<ol>
    <li>
        <title>Existence of antiderivative</title>
        <p>
            <m>f</m> has an antiderivative on <m>U</m>. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <title>Closed paths</title>
        <p>
            <m>\int_\gamma f\, dz=0</m> for any closed path <m>\gamma</m> lying in <m>U</m>. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <title>Independence of paths</title>
        <p>
            <m>\int_\alpha f\, dz=\int_\beta f\, dz</m> for any paths <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> lying in <m>U</m> that have the same initial and terminal points. 
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
</p>
</statement>
<proof>
<case>
<title>Implication: (1)<m>\implies</m>(2)</title>
<p>
Let <m>F</m> be an antiderivative of <m>f</m> on <m>U</m>. Given a closed piecewise smooth path <m>\gamma</m>, let <m>z_0=z_1</m> be its initial/terminal point. By the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals, we have 
<me>
    \int_\gamma f\, dz=F(z_1)-F(z_0)=F(z_0)-F(z_0)=0
</me>.
</p>
</case>
<case>
<title>Implication: (2)<m>\implies</m>(3)</title>
<p>
Since <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> share the same initial and terminal points, the curve  <m>\gamma=\alpha* (-\beta)</m> is closed, and we have 
<me>
    0=\int_\gamma f\, dz=\int_\alpha f\, dz+\int_{-\beta}f\, dz=\int_\alpha f\, dz-\int_\beta f\, dz
</me>.
It follow that 
<me>
    \int_\alpha f\, dz=\int_\beta f\, dz
</me>,
as desired.
