    <title>Cauchy-Goursat theorem</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In this section we meet the famous Cauchy-Goursat theorem: our first truly deep theorem, and one that is fundamental to all the theoretical highlights that follow.

<title>Existence of antiderivatives</title>
<convention>
    <title>Paths</title>
    <p>
        From now on, unless explicitly stated otherwise, a path <m>\gamma\colon [a,b]\rightarrow \C</m> will be assumed to be piecewise smooth. 
    </p>
</convention>
<p>
    As we observed in <xref ref="cor_FTC"/>, if <m>f</m> has an antiderivative on the open set <m>U</m>, then <m>\int_\gamma f\, dz=0</m> for any closed path lying in <m>U</m>. Equivalently, if <m>\int_\gamma f\, dz\ne 0</m> <em>for some</em> closed path lying in <m>U</m>, then there is no antiderivative of <m>f</m> on <m>U</m>. 
</p>
<p>
    Applying this result to <m>f(z)=1/z</m>, we see that for any open connected set <m>U</m> containing <m>0</m>, there is no antiderivative of <m>f</m> on <m>U-\{0\}</m>: indeed, the path <m>\gamma(t)=re^{it}</m> lies in <m>U</m> for <m>r</m> small enough, and we have computed that <m>\int_\gamma 1/z\, dz=2\pi i\ne 0</m> for any such path. As a further consequence, it follows that there can be no branch of <m>\log</m> on an open set of the form <m>U-\{0\}</m> where <m>U</m> contains <m>0</m>, since as we have seen previously, any such branch would be an antiderivative of <m>f</m>!
</p>
<p>
    The example illustrates the subtlety of the question of whether an antiderivative exists for a continuous complex function. The next theorem tells us that the implication from <xref ref="cor_FTC"/> is in fact an equivalence if <m>U</m> is open and connected.  
</p>
<theorem xml:id="th_antider">
<title>Antiderivative theorem</title>
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>U\subseteq \C</m> be open and connected, and assume <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>U</m>. The following statements are equivalent. 
<ol>
    <li>
        <title>Existence of antiderivative</title>
        <p>
            <m>f</m> has an antiderivative on <m>U</m>.

    <li>
        <title>Closed paths</title>
        <p>
            <m>\int_\gamma f\, dz=0</m> for any closed path <m>\gamma</m> lying in <m>U</m>.

    <li>
        <title>Independence of paths</title>
        <p>
            <m>\int_\alpha f\, dz=\int_\beta f\, dz</m> for any paths <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> lying in <m>U</m> that have the same initial and terminal points. 
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
</p>
</statement>
<proof>
<case>
<title>Implication: (1)<m>\implies</m>(2)</title>
<p>
Let <m>F</m> be an antiderivative of <m>f</m> on <m>U</m>. Given a closed piecewise smooth path <m>\gamma</m>, let <m>z_0=z_1</m> be its initial/terminal point. By the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals, we have 
<me>
    \int_\gamma f\, dz=F(z_1)-F(z_0)=F(z_0)-F(z_0)=0
</me>.
</p>
</case>
<case>
<title>Implication: (2)<m>\implies</m>(3)</title>
<p>
Since <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> share the same initial and terminal points, the curve  <m>\gamma=\alpha* (-\beta)</m> is closed, and we have 
<me>
    0=\int_\gamma f\, dz=\int_\alpha f\, dz+\int_{-\beta}f\, dz=\int_\alpha f\, dz-\int_\beta f\, dz
</me>.
It follow that 
<me>
    \int_\alpha f\, dz=\int_\beta f\, dz
</me>,
as desired. 
</p>
</case>
<case>
<title>Implication: (3)<m>\implies</m>(1)</title>
<p>
Pick any element <m>z^*\in U</m>. Since <m>U</m> is open and connected,  it is polygonally connected. Thus for any <m>z\in U</m> there exists a polygonal path beginning at <m>z^*</m> and ending at <m>z</m>. We define the function <m>F\colon U\rightarrow \C</m> as 
<men xml:id="eq_antider">
    F(z)=\int_{z^*}^z f\, dz
</men>,
where <m>\int_{z^*}^z f\, dz</m> denotes the contour integral along <em>any</em> polygonal path from <m>z^*</m> to <m>z</m>. Since we assume that line integrals of <m>f</m> are path independent, our function <m>F</m> is well-defined: <ie/>, <m>F(z)</m> does indeed return a single well-defined value, no matter which path you choose. It remains to show that <m>F</m> is an antiderivative of <m>f</m> on <m>U</m>. 
</p>
<p>
    Pick any <m>z_0\in U</m>. Firstly, since <m>U</m> is open we can find a <m>\delta&gt; 0</m> such that <m>B_{\delta}(z_0)\subseteq U</m>. We will prove that <m>F'(z_0)</m> by showing that 
    <me>
        F(z)-F(z_0)=f(z_0)(z-z_0)+r(z)
    </me>
    for all <m>z\in B_{\delta}(z_0)</m>, where <m>r(z)</m> satisfies 
    <me>
        \lim\limits_{z\to z_0}\frac{\abs{r(z)}}{\abs{z-z_0}}=0
    </me>.
    To this end note that for all <m>z\in B_{\delta}(z_0)</m>, we have 
    <md>
        <mrow>F(z)-F(z_0) \amp = \int_{z^*}^zf\, dz-\int_{z^*}^{z_0} f\, dz</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \int_{z^*}^{z_0}f\, dz +\int_{\gamma_{z_0,z}}f\, dz-\int_{z^*}^{z_0}f\, dz</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \int_{\gamma_{z_0,z}}f\, dz </mrow>
    </md>,
    where <m>\gamma_{z0,z1}</m> is the straight line path from <m>z_0</m> to <m>z</m>. Next, we have 
    <md>
        <mrow>\int_{\gamma_{z_0,z}}f\, dz \amp = \int_{\gamma_{z_0,z}}f(z_0)+f(z)-f(z_0)\, dz</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \int_{\gamma_{z_0,z}}f(z_0)\, dz+\int_{\gamma_{z_0,z}}f(z)-f(z_0)\, dz</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =f(z_0)(z-z_0)+\int_{\gamma_{z_0,z}}f(z)-f(z_0)\, dz</mrow>
    </md>,
    where the last step follows from the fact that <m>G(z)=z</m> is an antiderivative of <m>1</m>, and thus 
    <me>
        \int_{\gamma_{z_0,z}}f(z_0)\, dz=f(z_0)\int_{\gamma_{z_0,z}}1\, dz=f(z_0)(z-z_0)
    </me>,
    by the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Letting <m>r(z)=\int_{z_0,z}f(z)-f(z_0)\, dz</m>, we then have 
    <me>
        F(z)-F(z_0)=f(z_0)(z-z_0)+r(z)
    </me>.
    It remains to show that <m>\lim\limits_{z\to z_0}\abs{r(z)}/{\abs{z-z_0}}=0</m>. To this end, given any <m>\epsilon &gt; 0</m>, shrink <m>\delta</m> as necessary so that <m>\abs{z-z_0}&lt; \delta</m> implies <m>\abs{f(z)-f(z)}&lt; \epsilon</m>. We then have 
    <md>
        <mrow>\frac{\abs{r(z)}}{\abs{z-z_0}} \amp = \frac{\abs{\int_{z_0,z}f\, dz}}{\abs{z-z_0}} </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp \leq \frac{\epsilon \abs{z-z_0}}{\abs{z-z_0}} \amp (ML-\text{ineq.})</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp \leq \epsilon</mrow>
    </md>.
    Since <m>\epsilon</m> was abribitrary, we see that <m>\lim\limits_{z\to z_0}\abs{r(z)}/\abs{z-z_0}=0</m>, as desired.

        Given three non-colinear complex numbers <m>z_0,z_1,z_2</m>, we denote by <m>\gamma_{(z_0,z_1,z_2)}</m> any simple closed path of the form

            \gamma_{(z_1,z_2)}*\gamma_{(z_2,z_3)}*\gamma_{(z_3,z_0)}

        where <m>\gamma_{(z_i,z_j)}</m> denotes a simple straight-line path from <m>z_i</m> to <m>z_k</m>.

</p>
</statement>
<proof>
<p>
    We give a near complete proof, save for one unproved fact about closed and bounded sets (aka., <em>compact sets</em>). Let <m>\Delta=\Delta(z_0,z_1,z_2)</m> and let <m>\gamma=\gamma_{(z_0,z_1,z_2)}</m>.

Let <m>w_0,w_1,w_2</m> be the midpoints of the sides <m>\Delta</m> and consider the four closed paths

    <mrow>\gamma_4 \amp = \gamma_{w_2,w_0,w_1}</mrow>
</md>.
See <xref ref="fig_cauchy-goursat"/>. Using elementary integral properties, thanks to the cancellation that occurs due to <m>\gamma_4</m> we have
<me>
    \int_\gamma f\, dz=\int_{\gamma_1} f\, dz+\int_{\gamma_2} f\, dz+\int_{\gamma_3} f\, dz+\int_{\gamma_4} f\, dz

Picking any <m>1\leq k_0\leq 4</m> satisfying
<me>\max\left\{\abs{\int_{\gamma_k} f\, dz}\colon 1\leq k\leq 4\right\}=\abs{\int_{\gamma_{k_0}}f\, dz}

    <mrow> \amp \leq 4 \abs{\int_{\gamma_{k_0}} f\, dz}</mrow>
</md>.
Define <m>\gamma^{(1)}=\gamma_{k_0}</m>, and let <m>\Delta^{(1)}</m> be triangle enclosed by <m>\gamma^{(1)}</m>. Iterating this procedure on <m>\Delta^{(1)}</m>, we get a sequence of <em>nested</em> triangles
<men xml:id="eq_nested_tri">

<p>
We now use what really is a result about <em>compact sets</em>. We will refrain from giving the general topological definition of compactness; suffice it to say that in the context of <m>\C</m>, a compact set is just a closed and bounded set. A general fact about compact sets is that for any descending nested sequence of compact subsets like the one in <xref ref="eq_nested_tri"/>, the intersection of the nested sets is nonempty. Thus we can find a <m>z_0\in \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \Delta^{(n)}</m> that lies within all of our nested triangles. The remainder of the proof will try and give useful bounds on <m>\abs{\int_{\gamma^{(n)}}f\, dz}</m> by using the fact that <m>z_0\in \Delta^{(n)}</m> and <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>z_0</m>.

<title>Estimating <m>\abs{\int_{\gamma^{(n)}}f\, dz}</m> using <m>f'(z_0)</m></title>

Since <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>z_0</m>, we have 
<me>
    f(z)=f(z_0)+f'(z_0)(z-z_0)+r(z)
</me>
where 
<men xml:id="eq_r_func">

Note that the function

</me>
is a linear polynomial with antiderivative <m>G(z)=f(z_0)z+\frac{1}{2}f'(z_0)(z-z_0)^2</m>. It follows from <xref ref="cor_FTC"/> that <m>\int_{\gamma^{(n)}}g(z)\, dz=0</m>, and thus

<title>Proof that <m>\int_{\gamma}f\, dz=0</m></title>
<p>
To reach our desired conclusion, we will show that 
<me>
\abs{\int_{\gamma}f\, dz}\leq  \epsilon
</me>
for any <m>\epsilon &gt; 0</m>. To this end, fix <m>\epsilon &gt; 0</m>. Since the function <m>r(z)</m> defined above satisfies the inequality <xref ref="eq_r_ineq"/>, for <m>z</m> sufficiently close to <m>z_0</m> we have 
<me>
    \abs{r(z)} &lt; \abs{z-z_0}\frac{\epsilon}{L(\gamma)^2} 
</me>.
Clearly, we can pick <m>n</m> large enough so that this inequality holds for all <m>z\in \Delta^{(n)}</m>. A straightforward geometric argument shows that <m>\abs{z-z_0}\leq L(\gamma^{(n)})</m> for all <m>z\in \Delta^{(n)}</m>, and thus that 
<me>
    \abs{r(z)}&lt; \frac{L(\gamma^{(n)})\epsilon}{L(\gamma)^2}

for all <m>z\in \Delta^{(n)}</m>. 
We conclude that

</ol>
</p>
</statement>
<proof>
<p>
    The two statements are equivalent by <xref ref="th_antider"/>. Thus it suffices to prove (2). We will proceed in a manner much like the proof of <xref ref="th_antider"/>. Pick a star-center <m>z^*</m> of <m>U</m>.  For any <m>z\in U</m> we define <m>F(z)=\int_{\gamma_{z^*,z}}f\, dz</m>, where for any two points <m>w, w'</m> we denote by <m>\gamma_{w,w'}</m> the straight-line path between them. Note that the question of <m>F</m> being well defined does not even arise here, as we have specified an explicit path to compute the integral over. 
</p>
<p>
    As in the proof of <xref ref="th_antider"/>, we first pick a <m>\delta</m> such that <m>B_{\delta}(z_0)\subseteq U</m>. As long as we can show that 
    <men xml:id="eq_star">
        F(z)-F(z_0)=\int_{\gamma_{z_0,z}}f\, dz
    </men>
    for all <m>z\in B_{\delta}(z_0)</m> the rest of the proof of <xref ref="th_antider"/> follows to show that <m>F'(z_0)=f(z_0)</m>. Showing that <xref ref="eq_star"/> holds in this situation requires a little work, however, since we cannot assume that line integrals are path independent! Instead, we make use of <xref ref="th_cauchy-goursat_triangle"/>. Using the fact that <m>U</m> is star-shaped, it is easy to see that for any <m>z\in B_{\delta}(z_0)</m>, the entire triangle <m>\Delta(z^*,z_0,z)</m> is contained in <m>U</m>. The Cauchy-Goursat theorem for triangles then applies, yielding 
    <me>
        0=\int_{\gamma_{z^*,z_0,z}}f\, dz=\int_{\gamma_{z^*,z_0}}f\, dz+\int_{\gamma_{z_0,z}}f\, dz+\int_{\gamma_{z,z_0}}f\, dz
    </me>,
    or equivalently, 
    <me>
        \int_{\gamma_{z_0,z}}f\, dz=\int_{\gamma_{z^*,z}}f\, dz-\int_{\gamma_{z^*,z_0}}f\, dz=F(z)-F(z_0)

    <title>Elementary versus simply connected</title>
    <p>
    Starting with some simple star-shaped regions like open discs, we can use <xref ref="th_elem_regions"/> to build an extensive collection of elementary domains. Indeed for any explicit example we consider, these tools will suffice to show that a given region is in fact elementary.
</p>
<p>
    That said, it is desirable to have some geometric intuition about whether an open connected set is elementary. As it turns out, there is a purely topological characterization of which subsets of <m>\C</m> are elementary: namely, <m>U\subseteq \C</m> is elementary if and only if it is open and <em>simply connected</em>. The notion of a simply connected set is a tad too technical for us to include in this course, but the intuitive idea is that an open connected set <m>U</m> is simply connected if given any two paths <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> in <m>U</m> with the same endpoints, we can be <em>continuously deform</em> <m>\alpha</m> to <m>\beta</m> without leaving <m>U</m>. Another, even less technical intuitive description of a simply connected region is that it is connected and <em>contains no holes</em>. 
</p>
<p>
   This intuitive notion of simply connected regions (and its relation to elementary regions) will suffice for our purposes. In more detail, given an open connected set <m>U</m>, we can use this intuition to identify it informally as simply connected or not, and hence as elementary or not. If it is then required of us to prove a given region actually is elementary, then we will be able to do so using <xref ref="th_elem_regions"/>.

    In the spirit of <xref ref="rm_elementary"/>, we state one more version of the Cauchy-Goursat theorem for connected regions bounded by piecewise smooth closed curves. Significant work must be done to show this last version follows from our previous versions. In particular, the result relies on the famous <em>Jordan curve theorem</em>, which says that if <m>\phi</m> is a closed piecewise smooth and simple parametrization of the curve <m>\mathcal{C}</m> the region within <m>\mathcal{C}</m> is simply connected.

            Note first that <m>f</m> is holomorphic on <m>\C-\{1\}</m>. Let <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> be the closed paths starting at the point <m>3</m> pictured in <xref ref="fig_eg_deform"/>. Since <m>\alpha</m> is closed and lies within the elementary region <m>U=\C-\{1-ti\colon t\geq 0\}</m>, and since <m>\beta</m> is closed and lies within the elementary region <m>V=\C-\{1+ti\colon t\geq 0\}</m>, and since <m>f</m> is holomorphic in both of these regions, we have 
            <me>
                \int_\alpha f\, dz=\int_\beta f\, dz=0
            </me>.
            Furthermore, letting <m>\gamma''=\alpha*\beta</m>, we have on the one hand 
            <me>
                \int_{\gamma''}f\, dz=\int_{\alpha} f\ , dz+\int_{\beta} f\, dz=0
            </me>,
            and on the other hand, thanks to the cancellation along the real line segments, 
            <me>
                \int_{\gamma''}f\, dz=\int_\gamma f\, dz+\int_{-\gamma'}f\, dz
            </me>.
            It follows that <m>0=\int_{\gamma}f\, dz+\int_{-\gamma'}f\, dz</m>, or equivalently,  
            <me>
                \int_{\gamma}f\, dz=-\int_{-\gamma'}f\, dz=\int_{\gamma'}f\, dz

            This follows from the classic integral formula <m>\int_{\gamma}1/(z-z_0)\, dz=2\pi i</m>, for <m>\gamma(t)=z_0+re^{it}</m>.
