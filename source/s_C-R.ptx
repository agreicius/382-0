    <title>Cauchy-Riemann equations</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We come at last to our first important result, the <em>Cauchy-Riemann equations</em>, which express the differentiability of a complex function <m>f</m> in terms of its real and imaginary parts.

    <title>Cauchy-Riemann equations</title>
    <p>
        The Cauchy-Riemann equations involve the partial derivatives of the real and imaginary parts of a complex function. We give a brief reminder of the definitions and notation around this concept. 
    </p>
    <convention>
        <title>Partial derivatives</title>
        <p>
            Given a real-valued function <m>u(x,y)</m> of two real variables and an interior point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> of its domain, the partial derivatives of <m>u</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> with respect to <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are defined as 
        <md>
            <mrow>u_x(x_0,y_0) \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{u(x_0+h,y_0)-u(x_0,y_0)}{h}
            \amp 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>u_y(x_0,y_0) \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{u(x_0,y_0+h)-u(x_0,y_0)}{h} \amp </mrow>
        </md>,
        provided of course these limits exist. We denote the resulting partial derivative functions as <m>u_x</m> and <m>u_y</m>, or alternatively as <m>\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}</m> and <m>\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}</m>. 
        </p>
    </convention>
    <theorem xml:id="th_C-R">
    <title>Cauchy-Riemann equations</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
    If <m>f=u+iv</m> is differentiable at <m>z_0=x_0+iy_0</m>, then the first-order partial derivatives of <m>u(x,y)</m> and <m>v(x,y)</m> exist at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> and satisfy the <term>Cauchy-Riemann equations</term>:

    </mdn>.
    Furthermore, we have 
    <men xml:id="eq_der_u_v">
        f'(z_0)=u_x(x_0,y_0)+iv_x(x_0,y_0)

    <title>Cauchy-Riemann verification</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
    Verify that the real and imaginary parts of the holomorphic function <m>f(z)=z^2</m> satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations for all <m>z\in \C</m>, and that <m>f'(z)</m> satisfies <xref ref="eq_der_u_v"/>. 
    </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
    <p>
    We have <m>f=u+iv</m>, where <m>u(x,y)=x^2-y^2</m>, <m>v(x,y)=2xy</m>, and thus

    It is clear from these computations that

        <mrow>u_x \amp= v_y \amp u_y \amp = -v_x</mrow>
    </md>.
    Furthermore, we saw previously that <m>f'(z)=2z</m>, and hence that

    </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
    <p>
    We have <m>f=u+iv</m>, where <m>u(x,y)=x</m> and <m>v(x,y)=-y</m>. Thus for any <m>z=x+iy</m> we have

    It follow that for all <m>z_0=x_0+iy_0</m> we have 
    <me>
        u_x(x_0,y_0)=1\ne -1 =v_y(x_0,y_0)

    We conclude that for all <m>z_0\in \C</m>, <m>f</m> is not differentiable at <m>z_0</m>, as claimed.

    <p>
        As stated, <xref ref="th_C-R"/> provides only a <em>necessary</em> condition for <m>f'</m> to exist at <m>z_0</m>; it makes no claim as to whether this condition is <em>sufficient</em>. The next theorem improves on this slightly, by establishing something close, but not quite equal to the converse of <xref ref="th_C-R"/>. In more detail, it asserts that if the first-order partial derivatives of <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations and are <em>continuous</em> at <m>z_0</m>, then <m>f'</m> is differentiable at <m>z_0</m>. We will see later that in fact this is extra condition is unnecessary: <ie/>, that the implication in <xref ref="th_C-R"/> is in fact an equivalence without the additional continuity condition.
