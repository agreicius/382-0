    <introduction>
        <p>
            We come at last to our first important result, the <em>Cauchy-Riemann equations</em>, which express the differentiability of a complex function <m>f</m> in terms of its real and imaginary parts.

    <title>Cauchy-Riemann equations</title>
    <p>
        The Cauchy-Riemann equations involve the partial derivatives of the real and imaginary parts of a complex function. We give a brief reminder of the definitions and notation around this concept. 
    </p>
    <convention>
        <title>Partial derivatives</title>
        <p>
            Given a real-valued function <m>u(x,y)</m> of two real variables and an interior point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> of its domain, the partial derivatives of <m>u</m> at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> with respect to <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are defined as 
        <md>
            <mrow>u_x(x_0,y_0) \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{u(x_0+h,y_0)-u(x_0,y_0)}{h}
            \amp 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>u_y(x_0,y_0) \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{u(x_0,y_0+h)-u(x_0,y_0)}{h} \amp </mrow>
        </md>,
        provided of course these limits exist. We denote the resulting partial derivative functions as <m>u_x</m> and <m>u_y</m>, or alternatively as <m>\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}</m> and <m>\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}</m>. 
        </p>
    </convention>
    <theorem xml:id="th_C-R">
    <title>Cauchy-Riemann equations</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
    If <m>f=u+iv</m> is differentiable at <m>z_0=x_0+iy_0</m>, then the first-order partial derivatives of <m>u(x,y)</m> and <m>v(x,y)</m> exist at <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> and satisfy the <term>Cauchy-Riemann equations</term>:

    We have <m>f=u+iv</m>, where <m>u(x,y)=x</m> and <m>v(x,y)=-y</m>. Thus for any <m>z=x+iy</m> we have

    <p>
        As stated, <xref ref="th_C-R"/> provides only a <em>necessary</em> condition for <m>f'</m> to exist at <m>z_0</m>; it makes no claim as to whether this condition is <em>sufficient</em>. The next theorem improves on this slightly, by establishing something close, but not quite equal to the converse of <xref ref="th_C-R"/>. Roughly speaking, it asserts that satisfaction of the Cauchy-Riemann equations suffices as long as we throw in a certain continuity condition on the first-order partial derivatives.  We will see later that when considering differentiability on open sets this extra condition is in fact automatically satisfied, yielding a true equivalence. 
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="th_C-R_cont_equiv">
    <title>Cauchy-Riemann converse</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
    Assume <m>f=u+iv</m> and that <m>z_0=x_0+iy_0</m> is an interior point of the domain of <m>f</m>. If the first-order partial derivatives of <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are continuous on an open set containing <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, then <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>z_0</m>.  
    </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
    <p>
        In lieu of a proof, we indicate the ideas at play. As it turns out, the condition we actually need, in addition to the satisfaction of the Cauchy-Riemann equations, is that the function

            <mrow>f\colon \amp \R^2\rightarrow \R^2</mrow>
            <mrow>(x,y) \amp \mapsto (u(x,y),v(x,y))</mrow>
        </md>
        is <em>differentiable</em> in the sense of multivariable calculus. I will not include that definition here (look it up in your calculus text!), but suffice it to say that it is not equivalent to the partial derivatives of <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> existing. The additional continuity condition given in the theorem implies that <m>f</m> is differentiable in the multivariable calculus sense, and hence, that <m>f</m> is differentiable in the complex sense, assuming the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied. 
    </p>
    </proof>
    </theorem>

        As an immediate corollary of <xref ref="th_C-R_cont_equiv"/> we have the following corollary, which will be our main tool for investigating differentiability.

        As with good old-fashioned calculus, a complex function whose derivative is zero everywhere (on a <em>connected</em> open set) is constant. Let's see why this is so. First some definitions and conventions. 
    </p>
    <convention>
    <title>Restrictions and constant functions</title>
    <p>
        Given a function <m>f\colon D\rightarrow \C</m> and subset <m>D'\subseteq D</m>, we denote by <m>f\vert_{D'}</m> the <em>restriction</em> of <m>f</m> to <m>D'</m>: that is 
        <md>
            <mrow>f\vert_{D'}\colon D' \amp\rightarrow \C </mrow>
            <mrow>z \amp \longmapsto f(z)</mrow>
        </md>.
        Note that although <m>f\vert_{D'}</m> is defined via the same rule as <m>f</m>, if <m>D'\ne D</m>, it is technically a different function.
        </p>
        <p>Given <m>D'\subseteq D</m> we say that <m>f</m> is on constant on <m>D'</m> if there is a complex number <m>w_0\in \C</m> such that <m>f(z)=w_0</m> for all <m>z\in D'</m>. We will write <m>f\vert_{D'}=w_0</m> in this case.

<definition xml:id="d_locally_constant">

A function <m>f</m> is locally constant on a set <m>D</m> if for all <m>z_0\in U</m> there is an open ball <m>B_r(z_0)\subseteq U</m> such that <m>f</m> is constant on <m>B_r(z_0)\cap D</m>.

    Assume <m>f</m> is locally constant. Given any <m>z_0\in U</m> we can find an open ball <m>V=B_r(z_0)\subseteq U</m> such that the restriction <m>f\vert_V=w_0</m>. for some <m>w_0\in \C</m>. It is easy to see that <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>z_0</m> if and only if its restriction <m>f_V</m> is differentiable at <m>z_0</m>, and that 
    <me>
        f'(z_0)=(f\vert_V)'(z_0)=0
    </me>,
    since <m>f\vert_V</m> is constant. (See <xref ref="eg_derivative"/>.) It follows that <m>f'(z)=0</m> for all <m>z\in U</m>.

    <title>Implication: (ii)<m>\implies</m>(i)</title>

    for all <m>z\in V</m>. Since <m>V=B_r(z_0)</m> is connected, it follows from multivariable calculus facts that <m>u(x,y)=C</m> and <m>v(x,y)=D</m> for some constants <m>C,D\in \R</m> for all <m>z=x+iy\in V</m>.

It follows that <m>\Log z</m> is differentiable on <m>\C-(-\infty,0]</m> and that given <m>z=re^{i\theta}</m>, we have

    \frac{d}{dz}(\Log z)=e^{-i\theta}(\frac{1}{r}+0i)=\frac{1}{r}e^{-i\theta}=\frac{1}{z}

We conclude that

    \frac{d}{dz}\Log z=\frac{1}{z}

for all <m>z\in \C-(-\infty, 0]</m>, as desired.

For <m>z=re^{i\theta}</m>, we have

<title>Derivative of power function</title>
<statement>
<p>
Fix a complex number <m>w</m> and define <m>f(z)</m> to be the principle branch of <m>z^w</m>. Show that <m>f</m> is differentiable on its domain and compute a formula for its derivative. 
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
The function <m>f</m> has formula <m>f(z)=e^{w\Log z}=\exp(w\Log z)</m>. The derivative of <m>f</m> is easily computed using the the chain rule:
<md>
    <mrow>f'(z) \amp = \exp'(w\Log z)\cdot (w\Log z)'</mrow>
    <mrow> \amp = w\exp(w\Log z)\cdot \frac{1}{z} \amp (\exp'=\exp, (Log z)'=1/z</mrow>
    <mrow> \amp = \frac{f(z)}{z}</mrow>
</md>.
You were expecting <m>f'(z)=z^{w-1}</m>? Since <m>z^w</m> and <m>z^{w-1}</m> are not complex functions in themselves, the answer was never going to be this easy. However, writing 
<me>
    z^{w-1}=\frac{z^w}{z}
</me>
and swapping <m>z^{w}</m> out for <m>f</m>, we see that our formula is equivalent to the familiar power rule.
